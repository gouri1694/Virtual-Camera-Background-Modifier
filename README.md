# Virtual-Camera-Background-Modifier
A real-time virtual camera application that uses YOLOv8 segmentation to detect and isolate humans in the webcam feed â€” allowing you to:  Blur your background ; Replace it with a custom image; Black out everything but person. All done locally, with FastAPI backend and a simple web interface for control.
